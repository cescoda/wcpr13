
==DATA DESCRIPTION==

this data have been released as part of the
Workshop on Computational Personality Recogntion
(shared task). 2013.
this package includes two corpora:

essays.csv
 corpus for Personality Recognition from Text:
 includes authors, raw text and gold standard labels 
 (classes only).
 Texts has been originally collected by James Pennebaker,
 labels are derived by z-scores computed by François Mairesse
 and converted from scores to nominal scales by Fabio Celli.

mypersonality.csv
 corpus for Personality Recognition from Social Networks:
 includes authors, Facebook statuses in raw text, 
 gold standard labels (both classes and scores) and several
 social network  measures.
 Texts have been originally collected by David Stillwell and
 Michal Kosinski, and anonymized by Fabio Celli.
 Each proper name of person has been replaced with a *PROPNAME*
 string. Famous names, such as "Chopin" and "Mozart", and 
 locations,  such as "New York" and "Mexico", have not been
 replaced.

gold standard labels include:
sEXT	extraversion (score)
sNEU	neuroticism (score)
sAGR	agreableness (score)
sCON	conscientiousness (score)
sOPN	openness (score)

cEXT	extraversion (label: y=extravert, n=shy)
cNEU	neuroticism (label: y=neurotic, n=secure)
cAGR	agreableness (label: y=friendly, n=uncooperative)
cCON	conscientiousness (label: y=precise, n=careless)
cOPN	openness (label: y=insightful, n=unimaginative)


===SHARED TASK GUIDELINES===

Resources.
Please run the experiments for the shared task using at least one 
of the two datasets provided by the workshop organizers. You can add 
annotation levels to the data using any type of external resource.

Data Splitting.
Datasets are not divided into development, training and
test set. You are free to split the training and test sets
as you wish, although we suggest to use Weka 
(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
with 66% training and 33% test settings.

Evaluation.
We provide data with 2 kind of personality labels: scores and classes.
We suggest to use Precision, Recall and F1-measure to evaluate predictions
on classes, and Mean Absolute Error to evaluate predictions on
personality scores.

Baselines.
The Essays corpus has been used by Mairesse et Al 2007. You can refer to:
 François Mairesse, Marilyn Walker, Matthias Mehl and Roger Moore. 2007.
 Using Linguistic Cues for the Automatic Recognition of Personality 
 in Conversation and Text. 
 Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 30: 457-500.
 (http://people.csail.mit.edu/francois/research/)
No baseline is provided for the myPersonality Facebook corpus.
We suggest to compute random or majority baselines if needed.


===TERMS OF USE===

Confidentiality.
You cannot send the database to any other party, nor disclose to anyone else
the information contained within it as well as its structure.

Anonymisation.
We have anonymised the dataset. You cannot attempt to reverse this by linking 
individual records with specific users. This means that you also should 
not link individual data with any other information about an individual that 
you may have. This implies that you cannot attempt to contact any 
individuals either.

Non-Commerical License.
We grant you a non-commercial license to use the data. You can only use it 
for academic research that does not earn revenue, and your research also 
cannot be in collaboration with any commercial entities.

Recoverability.
The license to use and store our data is recoverable, which means that 
myPersonality may ask you to cease use of it and to delete it from any storage 
you have at our sole discretion.
