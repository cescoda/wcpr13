Well
,
right
now
I
just
woke
up
from
a
mid-day
nap
.
It
's
sort
of
weird
,
but
ever
sinc
I
move
to
Texa
,
I
have
had
problem
concentr
on
thing
.
I
rememb
start
my
homework
in
1
th
grade
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
1
and
not
stop
until
it
wa
done
.
Of
cours
it
wa
easier
,
but
I
still
did
it
.
But
when
I
move
here
,
the
homework
got
a
littl
more
challeng
and
there
wa
a
lot
more
busi
work
,
and
so
I
decid
not
to
spend
hour
do
it
,
and
just
get
by
.
But
the
thing
wa
that
I
alway
paid
attent
in
class
and
just
plain
out
knew
the
stuff
,
and
now
that
I
look
back
,
if
I
had
realli
work
hard
and
stay
on
track
the
last
two
year
without
get
lazi
,
I
would
have
been
a
geniu
,
but
hey
,
that
's
all
good
.
It
's
too
late
to
correct
the
past
,
but
I
do
n't
realli
know
how
to
stay
focus
n
the
futur
.
The
one
thing
I
know
is
that
when
peopl
say
that
b/c
they
live
on
campu
they
ca
n't
concentr
,
it
's
b.
s.
For
me
it
would
be
easier
there
,
but
ala
,
I
'm
live
at
home
under
the
watch
eye
of
my
parent
and
a
littl
nag
sister
that
just
nag
and
nag
and
nag
.
You
get
my
point
.
Anoth
thing
is
,
is
that
it
's
just
a
hassl
to
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
school
to
just
to
go
to
librari
to
studi
.
I
need
to
move
out
,
but
I
do
n't
know
how
to
tell
them
.
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
I
see
where
they
're
come
from
and
whi
they
do
n't
want
me
to
move
out
,
but
I
need
to
get
away
and
be
on
my
own
.
They
've
shelter
me
so
much
and
I
do
n't
have
a
worri
in
the
world
.
The
onli
thing
that
they
ask
me
to
do
is
keep
my
room
clean
and
help
out
with
the
busi
onc
in
a
while
,
but
I
ca
n't
even
do
that
.
But
I
need
to
.
But
I
got
enough
money
from
UT
to
live
at
a
dorm
or
apart
next
semest
and
I
think
I
'll
take
advantag
of
that
.
But
off
that
topic
now
,
I
went
to
sixth
street
last
night
and
had
a
blast
.
I
have
n't
been
there
in
so
long
.
Now
I
know
whi
I
love
Austin
so
much
.
When
I
live
in
VA
,
I
use
to
go
up
to
DC
all
the
time
and
had
a
blast
,
but
here
,
there
are
so
mani
student
run
around
at
night
.
I
just
want
to
have
some
fun
and
I
know
that
I
am
respons
enough
to
be
abl
to
have
fun
,
but
keep
my
prioriti
straight
.
Live
at
home
,
I
ca
n't
go
out
at
all
without
them
ask
where
?
with
who
?
whi
?
when
are
you
come
back
?
and
all
those
question
.
I
just
wish
I
could
be
treat
like
a
respons
person
for
onc
,
but
my
sister
screw
that
up
for
me
.
She
went
crazi
the
second
she
move
into
colleg
and
mess
up
her
whole
colleg
career
by
parti
too
much
.
And
that
's
the
ultim
reason
that
they
do
n't
want
me
to
go
and
have
fun
.
But
I
'm
not
littl
anymor
,
and
they
need
to
let
me
go
and
explor
the
world
,
but
I
'm
Indian
;
with
Indian
cultur
,
with
Indian
valu
.
They
go
against
``
''
have
fun
.
``
``
I
mean
in
the
sens
of
meet
peopl
or
go
out
with
peopl
or
parti
or
just
plain
have
fun
.
My
school
is
difficult
alreadi
,
but
somehow
I
think
that
have
more
freedom
will
put
more
pressur
on
me
to
do
better
in
school
b/c
that
's
what
my
parent
and
ultim
I
expect
of
myself
.
Well
it
's
been
fun
write
,
I
do
n't
know
if
you
go
anyth
out
of
thi
write
,
but
it
help
me
get
some
of
my
thought
into
order
.
So
I
hope
you
had
fun
read
it
and
good
luck
TA
's
.
