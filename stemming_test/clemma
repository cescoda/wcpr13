well
right
now
i
just
woke
up
from
a
mid
day
nap
it
s
sort
of
weird
but
ever
since
i
moved
to
texas
i
have
had
problem
concentrating
on
thing
i
remember
starting
my
homework
in
th
grade
a
soon
a
the
clock
struck
and
not
stopping
until
it
wa
done
of
course
it
wa
easier
but
i
still
did
it
but
when
i
moved
here
the
homework
got
a
little
more
challenging
and
there
wa
a
lot
more
busy
work
and
so
i
decided
not
to
spend
hour
doing
it
and
just
getting
by
but
the
thing
wa
that
i
always
paid
attention
in
class
and
just
plain
out
knew
the
stuff
and
now
that
i
look
back
if
i
had
really
worked
hard
and
stayed
on
track
the
last
two
year
without
getting
lazy
i
would
have
been
a
genius
but
hey
that
s
all
good
it
s
too
late
to
correct
the
past
but
i
do
n
t
really
know
how
to
stay
focused
n
the
future
the
one
thing
i
know
is
that
when
people
say
that
b
c
they
live
on
campus
they
ca
n
t
concentrate
it
s
b
s
for
me
it
would
be
easier
there
but
ala
i
m
living
at
home
under
the
watchful
eye
of
my
parent
and
a
little
nagging
sister
that
just
nag
and
nag
and
nag
you
get
my
point
another
thing
is
is
that
it
s
just
a
hassle
to
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
school
to
just
to
go
to
library
to
study
i
need
to
move
out
but
i
do
n
t
know
how
to
tell
them
do
n
t
get
me
wrong
i
see
where
they
re
coming
from
and
why
they
do
n
t
want
me
to
move
out
but
i
need
to
get
away
and
be
on
my
own
they
ve
sheltered
me
so
much
and
i
do
n
t
have
a
worry
in
the
world
the
only
thing
that
they
ask
me
to
do
is
keep
my
room
clean
and
help
out
with
the
business
once
in
a
while
but
i
ca
n
t
even
do
that
but
i
need
to
but
i
got
enough
money
from
ut
to
live
at
a
dorm
or
apartment
next
semester
and
i
think
i
ll
take
advantage
of
that
but
off
that
topic
now
i
went
to
sixth
street
last
night
and
had
a
blast
i
have
n
t
been
there
in
so
long
now
i
know
why
i
love
austin
so
much
when
i
lived
in
va
i
used
to
go
up
to
dc
all
the
time
and
had
a
blast
but
here
there
are
so
many
student
running
around
at
night
i
just
want
to
have
some
fun
and
i
know
that
i
am
responsible
enough
to
be
able
to
have
fun
but
keep
my
priority
straight
living
at
home
i
ca
n
t
go
out
at
all
without
them
asking
where
with
who
why
when
are
you
coming
back
and
all
those
question
i
just
wish
i
could
be
treated
like
a
responsible
person
for
once
but
my
sister
screwed
that
up
for
me
she
went
crazy
the
second
she
moved
into
college
and
messed
up
her
whole
college
career
by
partying
too
much
and
that
s
the
ultimate
reason
that
they
do
n
t
want
me
to
go
and
have
fun
but
i
m
not
little
anymore
and
they
need
to
let
me
go
and
explore
the
world
but
i
m
indian
with
indian
culture
with
indian
value
they
go
against
having
fun
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
meeting
people
or
going
out
with
people
or
partying
or
just
plain
having
fun
my
school
is
difficult
already
but
somehow
i
think
that
having
more
freedom
will
put
more
pressure
on
me
to
do
better
in
school
b
c
that
s
what
my
parent
and
ultimately
i
expect
of
myself
well
it
s
been
fun
writing
i
do
n
t
know
if
you
go
anything
out
of
this
writing
but
it
helped
me
get
some
of
my
thought
into
order
so
i
hope
you
had
fun
reading
it
and
good
luck
